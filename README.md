## GeoShout Front End

This is the front end of the GeoShout demo app. 

GeoShout is a basic full stack demo app that uses a variety of technologies. The app displays a map and allows the user to click anywhere to create a "shout" at that location (a simple message). At the same time, the app displays the nearest shouts on the map from the user and any other users of the app -- in other words, everyone sees each others' shouts. The shouts are transient and expire after a minute or two.

### What's Being Used Up Front:

 - Ionic 3 -- Ionic isn't just for mobile apps
 - Google Maps JavaScript API - for the maps/shouts (InfoWindows)/markers
